The Petful application resembles a simple adoption process for cats and dogs. This application ensures the first cat or dog on the list is adopted first before any others can be adopted. The animals would be arranged in a first in, first out order, meaning the animal that was at the shelter the longest would be the first one adpoted- ensuring no animal is a resident at the shelter for an extended period of time. Users wait in line and once it is YOUR turn you may adopt a cat or dog.
